# robocobot-line

My first real project in Python ever, sorry for the spaghetti code.

## Requirements

You need these libraries for this bot to work. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install them.

```bash
pip install discord
pip install python-decouple
pip install hentai
```

## Contributing
I don't know if anyone ever got interested with this, since there are many other codes that better than this. For the time being, I will ignore pull requests (if any to begin with).
